# MEMORY GAME - 2

This game has a table of 16 blocks and eight images in those blocks. Each picture will repeat twice. The Players will score when they flip over two matching blocks.

MEMORY GAME 2 also has a score and high-score tracking functionality for single players. Every time the players make a wrong guess, their score reduces by 2. Unlike [MEMORY GAME 1][memory-game-1], for wrong guesses, the blocks do not flip back.
